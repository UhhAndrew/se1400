        My competition is doing many things right as BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, Lamborghini, etc, all make great money but just don't have a single place to purchase all these cars in one spot. I think with this websit it will help the audience be able to find everything all in one place and can compare side by side instead of having to go back and forth on multiple websites.
